# MariaDB service documentation

This service only exports a connection pool to the MariaDB server.

Connection setting are given by environment variables. See the [how to setup the environment guide](../ENV_SETUP.md).

How many connection are allowed is defined by the configuration file. See the same guide as above to setup the value.

To see how to use the connection pool, refers to the [MariaDB connector manual](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/connector-nodejs-promise-api/).
